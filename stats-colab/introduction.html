<h2 id="goals">Goals <a style="color: rgb(20, 57, 168);" href="#goals"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h2>
\(1.)\) To give an introduction to the <b>mathematical theory</b> behind <b>statistical models</b>.<br>
\(2.)\) Understand the <b>limitations</b> of the <b>statistical models</b>.<br>
\(3.)\) Talk about theoretical guarantees (Which method is better than the other)<br>
After this chapter, we will be able to formulate a real-life situation in mathematics by selecting an appropriate statistical model.<br>
<br><br>

<h2 id="why">Why do we want to do statistics? <a style="color: rgb(20, 57, 168);" href="#why"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h2>
Now let's see where do <i>statistics</i> shows in real-life.<br>
<b>For example</b>, see this <a style="color: royalblue" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/07/18/upshot/nike-vaporfly-shoe-strava.html">New York Times article</a>, 
here it is claimed that,
<blockquote style="background-color:#f6f8fa; border-color: #fff; border-radius: 15px;">
    "These $250 running shoes will make you run faster"</i>
</blockquote>
They claim to have <b>500,000</b> running time for different shoes.<br>
And what we are trying to understand here is that, Is <b>500,000</b> running time is sufficient number? 
what if there are <b>5Million</b> or say <b>50Million</b>!<br>
<br>

<b style="font-size: larger;">Data</b> comes from a <b>random process</b>
They <b>aren't</b> just a <i>sequence of numbers</i><br>
And <span title="Here we are talking about our Data"><u>those</u></span>
 numbers are representative of that <b>random process</b>.
The goal of statistics is to <span title="Extrapolation is the process of finding a value outside a data set. It could even be said that it helps predict the future!"><u>extrapolate</u></span> from a finite number of data to what we can get if we had an \(\infty\) amount of observation. If we have an \(\infty\) amount of data we can describe a random process (but there still be some randomness), and this process helps us to make a prediction.<br>
To understand randomness, we need <b><i>Probability</i></b>(it's also prerequisite for <b>Statistics</b>).<br>
<br><br>




<h2 id="probability">Probability <a style="color: rgb(20, 57, 168);" href="#probability"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h2>
<span title="In probability"><u>Here</u></span> we have a description of a <b>random process</b> and we are asked about the outcome from that random process, like <b>expectation, probability distribution, etc</b>.<br>
Now the <b>question</b> is where does <b>Statistics</b> fit in all of this<b>?</b>.<br>
We don't need statistics to understand that, <i>A fair die has a \(\frac{1}{6}\) chance to outcome a 1</i> 
OR <i>A fair coin has a \(\frac{1}{2}\) chance to outcome a heads</i>.<br>
<blockquote style="background-color:#f6f8fa; border-color: #fff; border-radius: 15px;">
<b>But</b> what if we don't know about that <b>random process</b>, then we need <b>statistics</b> to figure it out.
</blockquote>
What if the coin isn't fair?, then we start flipping a coin, collecting the number of heads and tails, and then we would try to see that probability is converging to maybe 1/2.
<br><br>
Sometimes there is <b>real</b> randomness like a biased coin, measurement error,  etc.<br>
Sometimes there is <b>no </b>randomness, this is where most of the randomness comes from. There is no randomness in there (people don't think of themselves acting randomly), there is a huge component that we <b>don't understand</b>, when we talk about genes we are trying to predict personalized medicines based on gene profiles, gene profile tells a lot about some disease, they don't tell us everything. So there are things that we don't understand, it's just not accessible to us.<br>
<br><br>

<h2 id="modeling">Statistical Modeling <a style="color: rgb(20, 57, 168);" href="#modeling"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h2>
Think of a Complicated process what we do is we split this Complicated process into two parts, first is Simple process this is what we do understand about the process, and another one is random noise this is the thing that we don't understand.
<br> 
<blockquote style="background-color:#f6f8fa; border-color: #fff; border-radius: 15px;">
    <b>Complicated Process \(\equiv\) Simple Process + Random Noise</b>
</blockquote>
Good Modeling consists in choosing (plausible) simple process and noise distribution.<br>
<br>

<div class="'new_image">
<img id='dogma' src="img/dogma.png" alt="Central Dogma of Probability and Statistics"><br>
</div>

<span title="The image showed just above"><u>This</u></span> is the Central <span title="a principle laid down by an authority as incontrovertibly true."><u>Dogma</u></span> of probability and statistics, So what it's saying is:
<blockquote style="background-color:#f6f8fa; border-color: #fff; border-radius: 15px;">
We have a <b>truth</b>(Random Process) that generates <b>data</b>, and <b>probability</b> will tell us what our data look like.
</blockquote>
For example:
Say that we have our fair coin as <b>truth</b>, <span title="or say, we don't know the underlying pattern by which this sequence of heads and tails is emerging"><u>we don't know how it generates the sequence of heads and tails</u></span>, all we see is a (random) sequence of heads and tails.<br>
And if we don't know anything about the coin (like is it fair or not) it's the purpose of <b>statistics</b>, here we try to recover <b>truth</b> from <b>data</b><br>
<br><br>

<h2 id="kiss_ex">The Kiss Example<a style="color: rgb(20, 57, 168);" href="#kiss_ex"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h2>
Source: <a style="color: royalblue" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/421711a">https://www.nature.com/articles/421711a</a><br>
So the question here is, <i>"do people have a preference of turning their head to the right when kissing?"</i><br>
According to the author, the study concludes:<br>

<blockquote style="background-color:#f6f8fa; border-color: #fff; border-radius: 15px;">A neonatal right-side preference makes a surprising romantic reappearance later in life.</blockquote>
Data is very simple, a person goes out and records whether people turn their head, to the left or right.<br>
Now we want to do some <b>modeling</b>, So how can we tackle this problem?<br>
Now if a person collected data and (say) 90% of them turn their head to the right. then it's an indication that peoples do have a preference of turning their head to the right.<br>
But how to decide the <b>cutoff</b> (beyond which we can say Yes people do have a preference of turning their head to the right)?<br>
What if the data states that 51% of them turn their head to the right. then Can we say that it is an indication that peoples do have a preference of turning their head to the right?<br>

What we want, is to understand the true proportion of people turning there head to the right, in the entire population of the world.<br>
<br><br>

<h2 id="statistical-experiment">Statistical experiment<a style="color: rgb(20, 57, 168);" href="#statistical-experiment"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h2>
\(p\): Proportion of couples who turns their head to the right while kissing.<br>
\(n\): Total number of observation (say 1 for RIGHT and 0 for LEFT)<br>
\(\hat{p}\): estimator of \(p\).<br>
According to study \(n=124\) and \(80\) peoples turns their head to the right.<br>
\[\hat{p}=\frac{80}{124}=64.5\%\]<br>
64.5% seems to be \(\gt\)  50% but is it <b>significantly larger</b> then 50%?<br>
<br>
Say that we have <b>only 3 data points</b>.<br>
<ul>
    <li>Will you convince if we have 3 Right (\(\hat{p}=100\%\))?</li>
    <li>Will you convince if we have 2 Right(\(\hat{p}=66.66\%\))?</li>
</ul>

Intuitively, the question is \(n=3\) is too small \(n=124\) may be large enough, question is what is the right number for \(n\)?<br>
This question is important, <b>What your sample size should be?</b><br>

Another way to present this problem is, for \(n=124\) What is the minimum number of couples that move their head to the right would we need to convince ourselves that p\(\gt\)50%? or p\(\gt\)63% or p\(\gt\)72 or ...<br>
<br><br>

<h2 id="kiss_ex_est">Estimator<a style="color: rgb(20, 57, 168);" href="#kiss_ex_est"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h2>
<div class="math-container">
    \[R_i=\left\{\begin{matrix}
    1& \text{if }i^{th}\text{ turns to right}\\
    0& \text{if }i^{th}\text{ did not turns to right}
    \end{matrix}\right. ;\quad i=1,...,n          \\
    \
    \\
    \hat{p}=\overline{R}_n=\frac{1}{n}\sum^n_{i=1}R_i\]
</div>

<br>
\(\sum^n_{i=1}R_i\) is the number of \(1's\) so if I have \(80\ 1's\) in the sequence then \(\sum^n_{i=1}R_i=80\)<br>
\(\hat{p}\) is <b>Sample average \(\overline{R}_n\)</b><br>

Ok we got an estimator but what is it's <b>Accuracy</b>, how good is it,what does the accuracy even <b>mean? </b>
Accuracy of our estimator \(\hat{p}\) depends on <b>true</b> \(p\) which we don't even know.
We want to know how close is \(\hat{p}\)  to <b>true</b> \(p\) this is where <b>randomness</b> comes into play.
We think of \(R_i\) as random variables so that \(\hat{p}\) is also a random variable.
Now this random variable (\(\hat{p}\)) will tend to take some values \(\in [0,1]\).<br>
<br><br>

<h2 id="assumptions">Modeling assumptions<a style="color: rgb(20, 57, 168);" href="#assumptions"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h2>
Coming up with a model consists of making assumptions on what those \(R_i\)'s are, So here are the assumptions that we made:<br>
\(1.\quad\) Each \(R_i\) is a random variable.<br>
\(2.\quad\) Each \(R_i\) is a Bernoulli(we will see it later) with parameter \(p\)<br>
\(3.\quad\) \(R_1,R_2,...,R_n\) are mutually independent<br>

<br>

Remember that dogma we showed <a href="#dogma">above.</a><br>
<blockquote style="background-color:#f6f8fa; border-color: #fff; border-radius: 15px;">
    If you knew the <b>truth</b>(Random Process) you can generate how the observation looks like.
</blockquote>
And we want to go from <b>observation</b> to the <b>truth</b>(Random Process).<br>
Now let's focus on the <b>probability</b> to <b>statistics</b> part.<br>
So first we will generate a population of 5000 kissing couples artificially using our computers (or say python).<br>
Now we choose a true proportion \(p\), and if we took two different values of \(p\) like:\(p=0.35%\), \(p=0.65%\). We generate data separately for those \(p\)'s<br>
And then we generate 1000 samples of 124 couples, So here we are doing the experiment 1000 times, so we have 1000 samples then we create a histogram from those samples.<br>
</p>
